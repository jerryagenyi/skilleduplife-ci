# Feature 02: Admin Configurable Messaging Settings

## Objective / Purpose
Provide system administrators with a dashboard interface to configure messaging permissions for different user types and scenarios.

## User Stories (BDD-style)
- As a System Administrator, I want to configure company messaging settings so I can control platform communication
- As a System Administrator, I want to set default messaging permissions so new users have appropriate access
- As a System Administrator, I want to modify messaging rules so I can adapt to business needs

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin scenarios)

### Scenario: Admin configures company messaging settings
```gherkin
Given I am a System Administrator
And I am on the messaging settings dashboard
When I select "Setting 2" for company profiles
Then companies should be able to receive messages from Volunteers, PRO Volunteers, Volunteer Applicants, and Customers
And companies should not be able to receive messages from other Companies
```

### Scenario: Admin sets volunteer messaging permissions
```gherkin
Given I am a System Administrator
And I am on the messaging settings dashboard
When I configure volunteer messaging settings
Then the settings should apply to all volunteer profiles
And the message buttons should update accordingly
```

## Functional Requirements
- Admin dashboard for messaging configuration
- 6 predefined settings for company profiles
- Configurable volunteer messaging permissions

- Setting persistence and backup

## Edge Cases & Risks
