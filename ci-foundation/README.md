# 🚀 SkilledUp.Life CI/CD Foundation

> **Central CI/CD Implementation Hub for SkilledUp.Life Projects**

This folder serves as the foundation for implementing and maintaining consistent CI/CD practices across all SkilledUp.Life repositories. It provides standardized workflows, quality gates, and development guidelines to ensure code quality and deployment reliability.

## 📋 Purpose

The `ci-foundation/` folder is designed to:

- **Standardize CI/CD practices** across all SkilledUp.Life projects
- **Provide reusable workflows** for Vue.js frontend and Laravel backend projects
- **Establish quality gates** through automated linting, formatting, and testing
- **Onboard developers** with clear guidelines and expectations
- **Scale CI/CD impact** cleanly across multiple repositories

## 🛠️ CI Tools & Technologies

### Core Tools

- **ESLint** - JavaScript/TypeScript code quality and style enforcement
- **Prettier** - Code formatting and consistency
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD workflows
- **Husky** - Pre-commit hooks (optional enhancement)

### Framework Support

- **Vue.js Frontend** - ESLint Vue plugin, component-specific rules
- **Laravel Backend** - PHP linting, artisan test integration
- **Cross-Platform** - Unified quality standards across tech stacks

## 🎯 Quick Start

1. **Review the setup checklist**: [`ci-setup-checklist.md`](./ci-setup-checklist.md)
2. **Follow the onboarding guide**: [`getting-started-ci.md`](./getting-started-ci.md)
3. **Implement workflows**: Copy from `workflow-samples/` to your project
4. **Customize configurations**: Adapt rules in `eslint-config/` and `prettier-config/`

## 🔧 Implementation Workflow

### For New Projects

1. Copy relevant workflow files from `workflow-samples/`
2. Follow the setup checklist step-by-step
3. Customize ESLint and Prettier rules as needed
4. Enable GitHub branch protection rules

### For Existing Projects

1. Audit current CI/CD setup against foundation standards
2. Implement missing quality gates
3. Update workflows to match foundation patterns
4. Train team on new expectations

## 📊 Quality Gates

### Required Checks

- ✅ **Linting** - ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ **Formatting** - Prettier formatting compliance
