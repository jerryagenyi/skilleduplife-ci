# ðŸ§ª SkilledUp Life â€“ Regression Testing Workflow
# This workflow runs regression tests (subset of critical tests)
# Currently runs on pull_request only (non-blocking)
# Future: Will run on main branch merges to validate stability
# Note: Regression tests are the same test types (unit/E2E) but focused on critical paths
