## **🧱 Standard Feature Specification Template**

### **1\. 📄 Feature Title**

\> Clear and concise name (e.g., “Volunteer Profile Editing” or “Opportunity Save Function”).

### **2\. 🎯 Objective / Purpose**

\> A short paragraph describing what this feature aims to solve or improve. Example: *“Allow volunteers to update their personal details to keep their profiles current, making them more attractive to recruiters.”*

### **3\. 👤 User Stories**

\> Written from the perspective of the end user (BDD-style). Examples:

* “As a volunteer, I want to edit my profile so I can update my skills.”  
* “As a company, I want to see a volunteer’s current experience level before inviting them.”

### **4\. 📋 Functional Requirements**

\> A bullet-point list of specific features or interactions. Example:

* Volunteers can edit fields like name, bio, skills.  
* Submit button updates details via API.  
* Inline validation for required fields.

### **5\. ⚙️ Flow / Behavior**

\> Describe how a user interacts with the feature or attach a Figma link. Break down key interaction steps and conditions.

Example:

* User lands on profile page.  
* User clicks “Edit” and sees editable input fields.  
* User modifies details and clicks “Save.”  
* Changes persist and reflect on dashboard.

### **6\. 🧪 Test Matrix Table (Spec-to-Test Companion)**

| What | Why | How | Edge Cases | Acceptance Criteria | Suggested Test Name |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Edit Profile Fields | Volunteers maintain updated info | Display editable inputs → Submit → Persist changes | Invalid input / API fails | Inputs save, success toast shows, data reflects on reload | `test_profile_update_persists()` |
| Submit Validation | Prevent incomplete or broken profiles | Submit with empty required fields | All required fields blank | Form does not submit, shows validation messages | `test_profile_form_shows_errors_when_invalid()` |
| Backend Integration | Sync frontend inputs with backend | Submit → Check API payload and DB update | Backend down or misconfigured | Correct API endpoint called, user data updated | `test_api_request_on_profile_submit()` |

### **You can hand this off to QA or devs—or use it yourself if you get partial access.**

### **7\. 🧱 Dependencies / API Contracts**

\> Note any backend endpoints or frontend components this depends on. Example:

* Requires `PUT /api/profile/:id`  
* Depends on `<ProfileForm />` component

### **8\. ❗ Risks / Considerations**

\> Mention anything that might block success or require caution.

* “This will touch the profile DB schema.”  
* “Need to avoid overwriting data from incomplete saves.”

### **9\. ✅ Definition of Done (DoD)**

\> A clear, minimal checklist of what must be true before this is considered finished:

* \[ \] Form edits work  
* \[ \] API integration complete  
* \[ \] Tests written and passing  
* \[ \] Code reviewed and merged
