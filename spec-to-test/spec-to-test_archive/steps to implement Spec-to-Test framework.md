### **🧩 Part A: Spec-to-Test Plan – *Guidance Steps***

#### **🔹 1\. Create the Feature Specification Document**

* Define the **feature name**, **objective**, and **user stories**.  
* List **functional requirements** and expected user flows.  
* Include edge cases, system dependencies, and risks.  
* Use the full **Feature Specification Template** you’ve built for consistency.

  #### **🔹 2\. Develop the Spec-to-Test Matrix**

* For each feature, extract:  
  * What it does  
  * Why it matters  
  * How it behaves  
  * Acceptance criteria  
  * Suggested unit/component test names  
* Use one matrix per **module** or **epic**, depending on scale.  
* Make the matrix shareable with devs and QA (Google Sheet, Notion table, or Airtable).

  #### **🔹 3\. Generate Test Cases or Test File Stubs**

* Draft test case titles from the matrix (e.g., `test_user_can_save_opportunity()`).  
* If possible, work with the QA and dev to create placeholder test files:  
  * **Frontend:** `ComponentName.test.js` or `.test.jsx`  
  * **Backend:** `test_routes.py` or `test_api_save_profile.py`

  #### **🔹 4\. Create GitHub Issues for Tracking**

* For each test row:  
  * Open a GitHub issue  
  * Label it as `test-case`, `qa`, or `tdd`  
  * Tag the dev or QA responsible  
* Paste the corresponding row from the table into the issue body.

  #### **🔹 5\. Draft Pre-Commit and Dev Workflow Recommendations**

* Suggest file naming standards (`ComponentName.test.js`)  
* Recommend test placement (next to component or in a `__tests__` folder)  
* Provide pre-commit hook setup instructions (lint \+ unit test enforcement)  
* Propose a GitHub Actions file to run tests on every PR

  #### **🔹 6\. Kick Off a Mini Test Alignment Session**

* Share your document \+ test table with the team.  
* Run a 15–30 minute sync to:  
  * Assign ownership for each test  
  * Confirm spec understanding  
  * Ensure everyone agrees on “definition of done” for the feature
