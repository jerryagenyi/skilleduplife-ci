# The Plan

---

## **🛠️ Phase 1: Collaborative Testing Initiative (No Code Access Required)**

### **🎯 Goal**

Introduce TDD/BDD-style discipline **starting from the next new feature**, without interrupting current development or requiring codebase access.

Define TDD and BDD:

* **TDD (Test-Driven Development):** A development practice where tests are written before code. Developers write a failing test, implement code to pass the test, then refactor.   
* **BDD (Behavior-Driven Development):** A collaboration-focused approach that defines application behavior using human-readable scenarios, often driven by user stories.

### **👥 Core Working Group**

* **You:** Test strategy lead \+ spec-to-test framework author  
* **Frontend Dev**  
* **Backend Dev**  
* **QA Contributor**

### **🧩 Part A: Build the Spec-to-Test Plan**

**What you’ll do:**

* For each upcoming feature, extract requirements and write a shared **Feature Test Table** with the following fields:

| Module | Feature | What | Why | How | Edge Cases | Acceptance Criteria | Suggested Test |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

Use this format as your “TDD brief” to kick off the work. This becomes a blueprint the QA tester and devs can implement.

**Bonus:** Turn each row into a GitHub Issue labeled `test-case`, and tag the appropriate dev and QA.

### **🧩 Part B: Propose Lightweight DevOps Practices**

Create a 1-page “workflow recommendation” doc, proposing:

* **Test file naming**: `ComponentName.test.js` (adjacent to source)  
* **Folder structure**: Keep tests near components (recommended for tracking, visibility)  
* **Pre-commit tool**: Suggest `pre-commit` for linting and test enforcement  
* **CI setup**: Propose a `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml` for GitHub Actions

\> These are just recommendations—for now, the devs can implement them on their own branches.

### **✅ Deliverables in This Phase**

| Task | Owner |
| ----- | ----- |
| Create and share Spec-to-Test template | You |
| Coordinate testing expectations for next feature | You \+ QA |
| Review pull requests (once test coverage starts) | You |
| Adopt test naming conventions | Devs |
| Provide feedback to PO | You (with measured, clear rationale) |

## **🔄 Phase 2: Scaled Testing Framework with Code Access**

If you're eventually given **frontend or backend access**—or your working group includes someone who has it—upgrade to this phase.

### **🔓 A. With Access to the Frontend Repo**

You’ll now:

* Create test stubs directly in the feature branch using the Feature Test Table  
* Contribute to:  
  * `.github/workflows/run-tests.yml`  
  * `.pre-commit-config.yaml`  
  * Sample unit tests (React: Testing Library, Vue: Vitest, etc.)

\> Bonus: Begin tracking **test coverage** using tools like `jest --coverage` and reporting it in PR comments.

### **🔐 B. With Access to the Backend Repo**

Your backend teammate can:

* Write integration tests for the API  
* Run schema validation  
* Start a database fixture test suite

If you’re working with frameworks like FastAPI or Django, you can also introduce:

* Contract testing (e.g., using `pytest`, `pydantic`, or OpenAPI validation)  
* CI to test backend logic before merges

## **💡 Your MVP Strategy: Proof Through the Next Feature**

Take **one next feature**, build out:

* A complete spec-to-test plan  
* A prototype GitHub issue layout  
* Unit test suggestions and names  
* A short Loom video or deck explaining “why this matters”

Then pitch that to the PO as: 🟢 Low-risk 🟢 Feature-by-feature 🟢 Totally collaborative 🟢 No delays to current shipping
