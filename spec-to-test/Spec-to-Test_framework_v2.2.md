## 1. Background & Purpose

- Make development seamless and unified for a distributed, volunteer-driven team.
- Reduce bugs and broken code after merges.
- Ensure everyone works from the same clear, testable specifications.
- Minimise onboarding friction and ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù problems.
- Enable fast, reliable delivery of new features with confidence.

---

## 2. Team Development Standards

- **GitHub Actions is the main gatekeeper for code quality.**
  - All tests and checks run in CI before merging.
  - Multiple workflow YAML files can exist in the `.github/workflows/` folder per repo (frontend and backend). Each YAML file represents a separate workflow (e.g., `run-tests.yml`, `lint.yml`, `deploy.yml`).
- **Documentation, specs, and tests must be clearly organised and accessible in each repo.**

---

## 3. Unified Spec-to-Test Workflow

### Epic-Level Organization
For large features or modules, organize work as: **EPIC > Features > User stories > tasks**

**Epic Structure:**
- **Epic Overview** - High-level business objective and scope
- **Features** - Discrete functional areas within the epic  
- **User Stories** - Specific user needs within each feature
- **Tasks** - Implementation work items (specs, tests, code)

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create Epic Overview**
   - Define epic scope, business value, and feature breakdown
   - **Location:** `/docs/specs/[epic-name]/epic-overview.md`

2. **Write Feature Specifications**
   - Use the provided template (see section 5) for each feature
   - Include: feature title, objective, user stories, Gherkin scenarios, requirements
   - **Location:** `/docs/specs/[epic-name]/feature-[##]-[name].md`

3. **Write Gherkin Scenarios (BDD)**
   - For each user story/acceptance criterion, write Gherkin scenarios
   - These scenarios are the single source of truth for expected behaviour
   - **Location:** `/docs/gherkin/[epic-name]/` or within feature spec files

4. **Create Feature Test Tables**
   - Map Gherkin scenarios to specific tests and track coverage/ownership
   - **Location:** Within each feature spec or `/docs/testing/[epic-name]/`

5. **Generate GitHub Issues/Tasks**
   - Create issues for each feature following "Epic > Feature > User Story > Task" labels
   - Link issues to epic milestone and feature labels

6. **Implement Automated Tests (TDD)**
   - Write tests before or alongside development, guided by Gherkin scenarios
   - **Location:** `/tests/[epic-name]/` or `/src/__tests__/[epic-name]/`

7. **Develop Features**
   - Implement features to pass all tests
   - **Location:** `/src/[epic-name]/` or relevant component directories

8. **Review & Merge**
   - PRs only merged if all tests pass in CI
   - QA and PO review against Gherkin scenarios

## 5. Feature Specification Template

1. **Feature Title**
2. **Objective / Purpose**
3. **User Stories (BDD-style)**
4. **Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin scenarios)**
5. **Functional Requirements**
6. **Edge Cases & Risks**
7. **Dependencies / API Contracts**
8. **Definition of Done (DoD)**

---

## 6. Step-by-Step Implementation Guidance

1. **Create the Feature Specification Document**
   - Define the feature name, objective, and user stories.
   - List functional requirements and expected user flows.
   - Include edge cases, system dependencies, and risks.
   - Use the full Feature Specification Template for consistency.

2. **Develop the Spec-to-Test Matrix**
   - For each feature, extract: what it does, why it matters, how it behaves, acceptance criteria, suggested unit/component test names.
   - Use one matrix per module or epic, depending on scale.
   - Make the matrix shareable with devs and QA (Google Sheet, Notion table, or Airtable).

3. **Generate Test Cases or Test File Stubs**
   - Draft test case titles from the matrix (e.g., `test_user_can_save_opportunity()`).
   - Work with QA and devs to create placeholder test files:
     - **Frontend:** `ComponentName.test.js` or `.test.jsx`
     - **Backend:** `test_routes.py` or `test_api_save_profile.py`

4. **Create GitHub Issues for Tracking**
   - For each test row: open a GitHub issue, label it as `test-case`, `qa`, or `tdd`, tag the dev or QA responsible, and paste the corresponding row from the table into the issue body.

5. **Draft Dev Workflow Recommendations**
   - Suggest file naming standards (`ComponentName.test.js`)
   - Recommend test placement (next to component or in a `__tests__` folder)
   - Propose a GitHub Actions file to run tests on every PR

6. **Kick Off a Mini Test Alignment Session**
   - Share your document and test table with the team.
   - Run a 15‚Äì30 minute sync to assign ownership for each test, confirm spec understanding, and ensure everyone agrees on ‚Äúdefinition of done‚Äù for the feature.

## 7. Onboarding & Workflow Tips

- Gherkin scenarios and the Feature Test Table are required for all new features. Use them as the basis for tests and QA.
- Automated tests must pass in GitHub Actions before merging any PR.
- Keep documentation concise and up to date for easy onboarding.
- Use the summary table above to know exactly where to place each artefact in the repo.
