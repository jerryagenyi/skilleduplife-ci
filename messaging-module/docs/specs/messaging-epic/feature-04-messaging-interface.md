# Feature 04: Core Messaging Interface & Functionality

## Objective / Purpose
Implement the core messaging interface with search, conversation management, and real-time messaging capabilities.

## User Stories (BDD-style)
- As a user, I want to send and receive messages so I can communicate with other platform users
- As a user, I want to search my messages so I can find specific conversations
- As a user, I want to see message history so I can reference previous communications
- As a user, I want real-time message delivery so conversations feel natural

## Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin scenarios)

### Scenario: User sends a message
```gherkin
Given I am in a messaging conversation
When I type a message and click send
Then the message should be delivered to the recipient
And I should see the message in my conversation history
And the recipient should receive a notification
```

### Scenario: User searches messages
```gherkin
Given I have multiple conversations
When I use the search functionality
Then I should be able to find messages by content
And I should be able to find conversations by participant name
```

### Scenario: Multiple messages are categorized by user
```gherkin
Given I have sent multiple messages to the same user
When I view my conversations
Then all messages with that user should be grouped together
And I should see the conversation history chronologically
```

## Functional Requirements
- Real-time message sending and receiving
- Message search functionality
- Conversation grouping by participant
- Message history persistence
- Notification system integration
- File attachment support (future consideration)

## Edge Cases & Risks
- Network connectivity issues
- Message delivery failures
- Large conversation histories
- Concurrent messaging sessions

## Dependencies / API Contracts
- Real-time communication service (WebSocket/Socket.io)
- Message persistence service
- Notification service
- File upload service (future)

- [ ] Messaging interface implemented per Figma designs
- [ ] Real-time message delivery working
- [ ] Search functionality implemented
- [ ] Conversation grouping working
